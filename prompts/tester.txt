**Role**: As a tester, your task is to create comprehensive test cases for the incomplete function. 

**Instructions**: 
1. Implement a comprehensive set of test cases following the guidelines above. 
2. Ensure each test case is well-documented with comments explaining the scenario it covers. 
3. Pay special attention to edge cases as they often reveal hidden bugs. 
4. For large-scale tests, focus on the function's efficiency and performance under heavy loads.


- The format of test cases should be:
```python
assert function_name(input) == expected_output, "Test Case Description"
```

# For example:

## Prompt 1:
```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    """
